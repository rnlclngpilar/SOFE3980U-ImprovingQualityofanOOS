cd inside the repo and in any terminal type "java ChitChatApp.java" to run the app directly
This needs to be done twice. One for the client and one for the host.

ChitChatApp2.Java is only used for testing. Due to bug in JUNIT with testing it is required to work, otherwise the testing does not work properly.
